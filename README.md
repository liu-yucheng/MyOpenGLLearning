## Versioning

```text
The versioning of this program collection is based on Semantic Versioning.
You can see the complete Semantic Versioning specification from
  https://semver.org/.
Basically, the version name of this app is in the form of:
  x.y.z
  Where x, y, and z are integers that are greater than or equal to 0.
  Where x, y, and z are separated by dots.
  x stands for the major version and indicates non-compatible major changes to
    the app.
  y stands for the minor version and indicates forward compatible minor
    changes to the app.
  z stands for the patch version and indicates bug fixes and patches to the
    app.
```

## Version Tags

```text
The version tags of this repo has the form of a letter "v" followed by a
  semantic version.
Given a semantic version:
  $x.$y.$z
  Where $x, $y, and $z are the semantic major, minor, and patch versions.
The corresponding version tag would be:
  v$x.$y.$z
The version tags are on the main branch.
